# VariableFontsTest
Playing around with variable fonts and ChatGPT :)
Hopefully I'm not breaking any licence rule of the fonts?

### Compatibility
Color and variable fonts are not supported in all browsers, if you do not see anything try using the **latest** version of your browser.
As far as I know, Nabla uses cutting-edge font formats which is only supported in a few browsers for now, for example the latest versions of Chrome and Edge.
